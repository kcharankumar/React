   In the App constructor a state variable CurrentDataTime is declared and assigned current date time using the new Date().
   In componentDidMount(), when the components are rendered in DOM this method is called and at that time timer is started and for every
   second tick() method is called.  
   In tick(), every second state variable is updated with the current date and time.
    In componentWillUnmount(), timer is removed from memory.  In render(), <React.Fragment> is used instead of <div>.  
    Instead <React.Fragment>, we can use <> and </>.  This is equalent of <React.Fragment> and </React.Fragment>
